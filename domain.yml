        SpaCy has excellent pre-trained named-entity recognizers for this -- check out this [interactive demo](https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy-ent/).

  utter_duckling:
    - text: >
        Mhm, for this use case I would suggest the Facebook library Duckling 🐥
        To do so, use the DucklingHTTPExtractor component in your pipeline and spin up a duckling server as described in their [documentation](https://duckling.wit.ai/).
  utter_crf:
    - text: >
        I currently don't know a library that provides pretrained recognisers for that. You'll have to train the extraction by yourself using the CRFEntityExtractor component.
        So use that and annote your NLU data as described [here](https://rasa.com/docs/nlu/dataformat/).
  utter_nlu_tools:
    - text: >
        A great tool to get more NLU data is [Chatito](https://rodrigopivi.github.io/Chatito/).
